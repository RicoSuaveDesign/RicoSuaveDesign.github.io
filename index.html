			<h4>Call Me Rico</h4>
			<div><p>
			I am a computer science major at Carthage College. This portfolio was originally created on January 5th, 2016 for the web development class, taught by Mark Mahoney.
			This website will document my progress starting with my web development class, and may continue into further website development examples.
			Expect updates between 1 and 4PM on weekdays, since that's when class meets. Also expect updates in the middle of the night, as there will likely 
			be assignments that are put off until 3AM.<br/><br/>
			I also enjoy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ricosuavecosplays/">cosplay</a>, various webcomics, and <a href="http://www.starbolt22.deviantart.com">drawing</a>.
